  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The factory method pattern is a way to encapsulate instantiation
	and abstract away the "new" keyword to a class. While it can be
	a bit non-obvious what the benefits of this pattern are
	immediately, there are actually many. For one, consider that
	instantiation of our objects may require a lot of computation and
	steps which we would like to not worry about. Maybe an API call
	has to happen and a few methods need to be run in order to obtain
	the parameters that must be passed to the constructor. A factory
	class can encapsulate this within a single method call. 

	Other advantages of this pattern include polymorphism. Maybe you
	don't know which specific child class you need to instantiate at
	runtime, but your factory class can determine this and pump out
	the correct one. 

	It's a very simple idea with powerful advantages.
