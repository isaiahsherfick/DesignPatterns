  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object thereby
	letting you parameterize other objects with different requests,
	queue/log requests, and support undoable operations.

	We're encapsulating a request, which will allow us a lot of
	control over the system we're creating.

	This pattern can be combined with the composite pattern so that
	commands can be themselves a collection of other commands. For
	example, the "cut" command may be a "copy" and "delete" command
	executed as one command.
